- When a list of data is shown through RecyclerView in Kotlin, the following internal flow takes place:

1. The RecyclerView class is instantiated and added to the layout file of the activity or fragment that will display the list.

2. An adapter class is created, which extends the RecyclerView.Adapter class and provides the data and view holders for the list items.

3. The adapter is set on the RecyclerView instance using the setAdapter() method.

4. The RecyclerView then calls the adapter's getItemCount() method to determine the number of items in the list.

5. The RecyclerView creates a pool of view holders, which are recycled and reused as the user scrolls through the list.

6. When the RecyclerView needs to display a new item, it calls the adapter's onCreateViewHolder() method to create a new view holder for that item.

7. The RecyclerView then calls the adapter's onBindViewHolder() method, passing in the view holder and the position of the item in the list. The onBindViewHolder() method populates the view holder with the data for the item.

8. As the user scrolls through the list, the RecyclerView recycles the view holders that are no longer visible and reuses them for new items.

9. When the user interacts with an item in the list, the RecyclerView calls the adapter's onClick() method, passing in the position of the clicked item.

- Overall, the RecyclerView provides a high-performance, memory-efficient way to display large lists of data in Android applications. By recycling and reusing view holders, the RecyclerView minimizes the number of views that need to be created and destroyed as the user scrolls through the list, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user experience.
